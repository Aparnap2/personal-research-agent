## üöÄ Overview

The Research Intelligence Platform is a powerful, AI-driven research assistant that transforms complex research queries into comprehensive, data-driven reports. Built with a sophisticated LangGraph architecture, this platform automates the entire research workflow from planning and data collection to statistical analysis and visualization.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Advanced Research Automation**: Transform natural language queries into comprehensive research reports
- **Multi-stage LangGraph Architecture**: Sophisticated agent workflow with specialized nodes for each research phase
- **Data Validation & Quality Assessment**: Automatic validation of extracted data with quality scoring
- **Citation Management**: Automatic extraction and formatting of citations in multiple academic styles
- **Comparative Analysis**: Segment data across multiple dimensions for insightful comparisons
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Generate charts, graphs, and tables to represent research findings
- **Modern React UI**: Professional, responsive interface with dashboard analytics
- **Project History**: Track and revisit previous research projects

## üîç How It Works

The platform uses a multi-stage LangGraph architecture to process research queries:

1. **Research Planning**: Analyzes the query and creates a structured research plan
2. **Web Search & Content Scraping**: Gathers relevant information from authoritative sources
3. **Citation Management**: Extracts and formats citations from all sources
4. **Content Synthesis**: Processes and synthesizes information into coherent insights
5. **Quantitative Extraction**: Identifies and extracts numerical data from sources
6. **Data Validation**: Validates extracted data for quality and consistency
7. **Statistical Analysis**: Performs statistical analysis on validated data
8. **Comparative Analysis**: Compares data across different segments and categories
9. **Visualization**: Generates charts, graphs, and tables to represent findings
10. **Report Compilation**: Creates a comprehensive, professional research report

npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## üß™ Example Usage

1. Enter a research query like "Market size and growth projections for AI in healthcare diagnostics in North America for 2024-2026"
2. The system will process the query through its LangGraph workflow
3. Monitor progress in real-time as the agent works through each research phase
4. Receive a comprehensive report with:
   - Executive summary
   - Detailed analysis
   - Statistical findings
   - Comparative insights
   - Data visualizations
   - Citations and references
